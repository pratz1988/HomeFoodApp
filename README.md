# Home Services 

I built the Home Services web application as part of my GA ( General Assembly ) SEI bootcamp. The Home Services application is aimed at providing a market place for home based services, like food, child care & maid services. This is built in HTML, CSS, Express.js, Node.js, mongoDB . 

# How it works

There are two workflows in this app
 - From a provider perspecitve, you can add all the items and servies you want to be listed
 - From a consumer perspective, you can browse all the various services that are available and get all the necessary informaiton about them

# Tech behind this
The app is built in Express.js, Node.js, RestFul API, EJS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and mongoDB. It uses 'Bulma' CSS framework.
