# Home Services 

I built the Home Services web application as part of my GA ( General Assembly ) SEI bootcamp. The Home Services application is aimed at providing a market place for home based services, like food, child care & maid services. This is built in HTML, CSS, Express, Node.JS, mongoDB . 

# How it works

The end goal of the game is to match all the cards in pairs and win the game.

 - First you select the grid size ( 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 4x4 )
 - Start the game by clicking two cards - if the cards are a perfect match they will stay in the flipped state. If they are not, they will flip back.
 - Keep looking for matched cards
 - When you finish matching all the cards, you get a message 'Congrats, you did in x seconds, with a total of y moves. Well Done!'


# Tech behind this
The app is built in Jquery, HTML and CSS. It uses 'jquery.flip.min.js' library for flipping cards. For getitng the images, I am using a standard API ( http://www.splashbase.co/api/v1/images/random/)

# Future enhancements / Known issues

Enhancements

#1 - building an internal database / API for getting a known list of images and using that images for creating differnt sections of this game

#2 - add sounds to images so that Kids can learn the sounds along with the images
